  Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle tasks that
  might take some time to complete, such as reading a file, making an API
  request, or executing a database query. They are a fundamental concept in
  JavaScript and are frequently used in various contexts, including event
  handling, timers, and more. Here's a basic example of how a callback works in
  JavaScript:

  <p>
    Callbacks are crucial for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript
    because they allow you to define what should happen after an asynchronous
    task is finished without blocking the main thread of execution. This
    non-blocking behavior is essential for creating responsive and efficient web
    applications. However, callback hell or callback pyramids can become a
    problem when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations. To address this
    issue, JavaScript introduced Promises and async/await syntax to make
    asynchronous code more readable and maintainable.
